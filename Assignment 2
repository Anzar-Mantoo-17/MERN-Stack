Q1.  What is wireframe  ?
A wireframe is a visual representation or blueprint that outlines the basic structure and layout of a web page, app, or any digital interface. It's a low-fidelity, simplified visual guide that demonstrates the skeletal framework of the interface without the design elements like colors, images, or specific fonts.
Wireframes are created early in the design process to focus on the arrangement of elements, content positioning, and user interface functionality. They serve as a communication tool between designers, developers, and stakeholders, helping them understand the layout and functionality of the interface before investing time in detailed design work or coding.
These wireframes can be hand-drawn sketches, created using specialized software, or even made using simple tools like pen and paper. They help in visualizing the basic structure of the interface and serve as a foundation for the subsequent design and development stages.

Q2. What is Mock-up ?
A mock-up is a high-fidelity visual representation or a more detailed and polished version of a design concept. It's a static, visual model that represents the final appearance of a digital product, such as a website, application, or any user interface. Mock-ups provide a more comprehensive and detailed view compared to wireframes.
Key characteristics of mock-ups include:
1.	Visual Design Elements: They incorporate visual elements like colors, typography, images, and specific UI components to reflect the final look and feel of the product.
2.	More Detailed Structure: Unlike wireframes, mock-ups showcase more specific details, demonstrating the exact placement of elements, user interface features, and overall aesthetics.
3.	Static Representation: Mock-ups are generally static and do not contain interactive elements or functionalities. They serve as a visual reference for the final design.
Mock-ups are crucial in the design process as they help stakeholders and design teams get a clearer understanding of how the final product will look. They provide a more tangible and realistic representation of the intended design, allowing for feedback, testing, and iterations before moving on to the development phase. These visual representations help in aligning design ideas and ensuring that the final product meets the intended objectives and user expectations.

The website doesn’t rely on loud colors or hyperbolic imagery but instead incorporates softer tones to create an aesthetically pleasing digital environment and an enjoyable user experience.

Mubasic:
One of the most interesting features of the site is its unique Q&A section. As you scroll down the page, images pop up to accompany each question and answer.
Q4. Difference between Programming language and Scripting language.
Programming languages and scripting languages are both tools used to create software, but they have some fundamental differences in their use, implementation, and intended purposes.
Programming Languages:
1.	Compiled vs. Interpreted: Many traditional programming languages like C, C++, and Java are compiled languages. They require a separate compilation step where the code is translated into machine-readable instructions before execution. Compiled languages produce executable files that can run independently of the source code.
2.	Performance: Compiled languages often result in faster and more efficient code execution since they are translated directly into machine code.
3.	Usage: They are used for developing standalone software, system software, operating systems, and complex applications.
Scripting Languages:
1.	Interpreted: Scripting languages such as Python, JavaScript, and Ruby are interpreted languages. They don't require a separate compilation step. Instead, they are executed by an interpreter line-by-line during runtime.
2.	Flexibility: Scripting languages are typically more flexible and easier to use due to their dynamic typing, simpler syntax, and automatic memory management.
3.	Use Cases: They are commonly used for web development, automation, rapid prototyping, and performing specific tasks or scripts within larger systems.
Key Differences:
1.	Execution: Programming languages are compiled or may use a combination of compilation and interpretation, while scripting languages are generally interpreted.
2.	Performance: Traditional programming languages often yield faster performance due to the precompiled nature, while scripting languages may sacrifice some performance for ease of use and flexibility.
3.	Use Cases: Programming languages are used for larger software development, including system software, applications, and more complex functionalities. Scripting languages are used for smaller-scale tasks, automation, and web-related development.
However, with advancements in technology, the lines between programming and scripting languages have blurred. Some languages, like Python, which is often considered a scripting language, are versatile enough to be used for both scripting and broader application development. The distinction between the two has become less defined as newer languages incorporate features of both categories.

Q5. What is ECMA Script 5 ?
ECMAScript 5 (ES5) is a standardized scripting language specification for JavaScript. It is an iteration of the ECMAScript standard, defining the scripting language that forms the basis for JavaScript. ES5 was published in December 2009 by the Ecma International organization.
Key features and updates introduced in ECMAScript 5 include:
1. Strict Mode: ES5 introduced strict mode, which is a way to opt into a restricted variant of JavaScript. It helps to avoid common programming errors by throwing more exceptions and preventing certain actions. It's activated by adding `"use strict";` at the beginning of a script or a function.
2. Accessors: ES5 added getter and setter methods that allow for defining properties in objects. Getters are used to get the property value, while setters are used to set the value.
3. New Methods: Several new methods were introduced in ES5, such as `Array.prototype.forEach()`, `Array.prototype.map()`, `Array.prototype.filter()`, and `Array.prototype.reduce()`. These methods offer more efficient ways to work with arrays.
4. JSON Object: ES5 standardized the `JSON` object, adding `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` methods for parsing JSON strings and converting JavaScript objects to JSON strings, respectively.
5. Object.create(): The introduction of `Object.create()` method that allows creating a new object with the specified prototype object and properties.

Q6. Various versions of ECMA Ssript.
ECMAScript standards serve as a guide for implementing JavaScript in web browsers and other environments. Subsequent versions like ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and beyond have introduced even more features and improvements to the language, building upon the foundation laid out by ES5.
